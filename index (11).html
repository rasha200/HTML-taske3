   <p><i>4 out of 5 stars</i></p>
   <p>Are you ready for<b> Mutt Madness?</b> You can get into the fun at home by teaching your dog to actually play basketball.
     Move over Air Bud, your dog can soon be shooting hoops in your living room impressing all of your friends and family.</p>
     <br>
     <p>This movie has everything you should ask for:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>basketball</li>
        <li>Adog</li>
        <li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Once your dog knows hold, you need to teach your dog the cue for drop so that they can both pick up the “basketball” and then
         drop it into the hoop. Dogs naturally want to hold onto things that are of value to them and so we want our dogs to understand 
         that if they drop the ball they will be getting something even more valuable in return.</p>
